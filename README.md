### NLP Cosine Similarity Project
Use glove vectors and cosine similarity to explore and experiment with word embeddings.

### To use
Download pre-trained word vector set from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

The larger the set, the more word coverage you will get, but the more time the loading will take. 

Use ```loadGloveModel(name_of_file, path)``` to make a hdf file of this for later use.
