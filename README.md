### NLP Cosine Similarity Project
Use glove vectors and cosine similarity to explore and experiment with word embeddings.

### To use
Download pre-trained word vector set from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

The larger the set, the more word coverage you will get, but the more time the loading will take. 

### To run
Place a vector file into the empty directory ```glove_vector_sets```

Run from terminal ```python3 assignment4.py glove.6B.50d``` or ```python3 assignment4.py gloveVectorNameWithoutExtension```
